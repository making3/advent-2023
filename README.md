# Advent of Code 2023

This is my personal [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions as I go through them. Some are
partially cleaned up, some are not.

## Running

To run, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and:

```
node run.js --help
node createNewDay.js --help

# Examples
node run.js 1
node createNewDay.js 5
```
